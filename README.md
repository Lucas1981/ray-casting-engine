# Ray Caster in the style of Wolf3d written in TypeScript

After reading the Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D book, I wanted to build a ray-casting engine again. It's a lot of fun to do and better than my previous attempt from many years ago. It's fun to revisit, especially armed with more knowledge on how to structure projects. I still want to add wall textures and add items. I never could figure out how to handle occlusion for items, but after reading that book, I do, so now I want to implement it.
